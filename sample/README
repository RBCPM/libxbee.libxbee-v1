To use these samples, you must first install libxbee.
To instll, simply type `make install` and provide the root password.

If you cannot install the library for any reason, follow the instructions that can
be found in the Wiki (http://code.google.com/p/libxbee/wiki/install_libxbee) under
the title "But I can't install it!"

The compile line can be found at the top of the source files, surrounded by #ifdef
and #endif. These allow us to run the source file as a shell script. Simply type
`sh simple.c` to compile the simple sample.
If you do not have the library installed, you must edit the compile line.
