Welcome to libxbee!

I have proveded sample code in the ./sample directory. Hopefully this will help
get you up and running with libxbee. If you would like samples showing a different
aspect of libxbee, then please do not hesitate to file an 'issue' on the project
site, and I will get to it ASAP:
  http://code.google.com/p/libxbee/issues/list

Documentation is avaliable online in the project Wiki and also once you have
installed the library via the man page system.

  man libxbee

Please note that this project is still in development, so should not be used for
any purpose other than learning/playing/testing etc... Basically don't use it to
make money, and then hold me responsible if it breaks!

Feel free to contact me directly with any queries:
  attie@attie.co.uk


For those of you that are planning to use this on an embedded board, I have
included a small makefile (umakefile) that has only the information needed to
compile the library. I suggest you use this instead!
